                            Ballet (French: [bal…õ]) is a type of performance dance that originated during the Italian
                            Renaissance in the fifteenth century and later developed into a concert dance form in France
                            and Russia. It has since become a widespread and highly technical form of dance with its own
                            vocabulary. Ballet has been influential globally and has defined the foundational techniques
                            which are used in many other dance genres and cultures. Various schools around the world
                            have incorporated their own cultures. As a result, ballet has evolved in distinct ways.<br><br>

                            A ballet as a unified work comprises the choreography and music for a ballet production.
                            Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained ballet dancers. Traditional classical
                            ballets are usually performed with classical music accompaniment and use elaborate costumes
                            and staging, whereas modern ballets are often performed in simple costumes and without
                            elaborate sets or scenery.<br><br>
