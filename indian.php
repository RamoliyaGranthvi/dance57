                            Dance in India comprises numerous styles of dances, generally classified as classical or
                            folk.[1] As with other aspects of Indian culture, different forms of dances originated in
                            different parts of India, developed according to the local traditions and also imbibed
                            elements from other parts of the country.

                            Sangeet Natya Academy, the national academy for performing arts in India, recognizes eight
                            traditional dances as Indian classical dances, while other sources and scholars recognize
                            more. These have roots in the Sanskrit text Natya Shastra, and the religious
                            performance arts of Hinduism.

                            the respective state, ethnic, or geographic region. Contemporary dances include refined and
                            experimental fusions of classical, folk, and Western forms. Dancing traditions of India have
                            influence not only over the dances in the whole of South Asia, but on the dancing forms of
                            Southeast Asia as well. Dances in Indian films, like Bollywood Dance for Hindi films, are
                            often noted for freeform expression of dance and hold a significant presence in the popular
                            culture of the Indian subcontinent<br><br>
