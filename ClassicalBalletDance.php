                            Classical ballet is any of the traditional, formal styles of ballet that exclusively employ
                            classical ballet technique. It is known for its aesthetics and rigorous technique (such as
                            pointe work, turnout of the legs, and high extensions), its flowing, precise movements, and
                            its ethereal qualities.

                            There are stylistic variations related to an area or origin, which are denoted by
                            classifications such as Russian ballet, French ballet, British ballet and Italian ballet.
                            For example, Russian ballet features high extensions and dynamic turns, whereas Italian
                            ballet tends to be more grounded, with a focus on fast, intricate footwork. Many of the
                            stylistic variations are associated with specific training methods that have been named
                            after their originators. Despite these variations, the performance and vocabulary of
                            classical ballet are largely consistent throughout the world.

                            Ballet originated in the Italian Renaissance courts and was brought to France by Catherine
                            de' Medici in the 16th century.[1] During ballet's infancy, court ballets were performed by
                            aristocratic amateurs rather than professional dancers.[1] Most of ballet's early movements
                            evolved from social court dances and prominently featured stage patterns rather than formal
                            ballet technique.<br>
