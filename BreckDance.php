                            Breaking, also called b-boying, b-girling or breakdancing, is an athletic style of street
                            dance originating from the African American and later Puerto Rican communities in New York
                            City, United States. While diverse in the amount of variation available in the dance,
                            breakdancing mainly consists of four kinds of movement: toprock, downrock, power moves and
                            freezes. Breakdancing is typically set to songs containing drum breaks, especially in funk,
                            soul music and hip-hop music, although modern trends allow for much wider varieties of music
                            along certain ranges of tempo and beat patterns.

                            The modern dance elements of breakdancing originated among the poor youth of New York during
                            the early 1970s, where it was introduced as breaking. It is closely attributed to the
                            birth of hip-hop, as DJs developed rhythmic breaks for dancers. The dance form has since
                            expanded globally, with an array of organizations and independent competitions supporting
                            its growth. Breaking will now be featured as an Olympic sport, making its debut in the 2024
                            Paris Summer Olympics. Following the proposal by the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF)
                            the IOC decided to include Breaking on 7 December 2020.

                            A practitioner of this dance is called a b-boy, b-girl, breakdancer or breaker. Although the
                            term "breakdance" is frequently used to refer to the dance in popular culture and in the
                            mainstream entertainment industry, "b-boying" and "breaking" were the original terms and are
                            preferred by the majority of the pioneers and most notable practitioners.
