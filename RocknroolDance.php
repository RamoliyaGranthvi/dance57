                            From swing dance, which had come into being around 1920, there emerged Lindy Hop, the first
                            partner dance ever to feature acrobatic elements, which was later modified to suit faster
                            music, spawning dance steps to accompany rock 'n' roll as that genre developed. Today's rock
                            and roll dance has gone far beyond these origins, especially in its gymnastic
                            moves..<br><br>
                            The most obvious acrobatic feature of this dance sport are its kicks (into thin air) and its
                            gymnastic elements like lifts, jumps, throws and flips. Today's rock and roll dance is
                            focused on show and competition dance and, with the exception of its name, has nearly
                            nothing in common with earlier dance steps done to rock music. It is danced in pairs or in
                            formation and can even be danced with one male and two females simultaneously, a form called
                            "triples".<br><br>

                            Over the years rock and roll dancing has experienced several important changes: the former
                            6-basic step was converted into the modern tournament's 9-basic step with its typical kick
                            ball change. Other characteristics are techniques such as the man's body wave movement,
                            which he uses to fling his partner from a sitting position upwards, and the throwing basic
                            movement, where she steps onto his hands and is catapulted upwards into breakneck jumps.
                            Because of its demanding technique, high speed, and acrobatics, rock and roll is a straining
                            high-performance dance and is most often performed by young dancers.
