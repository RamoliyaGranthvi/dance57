                            "Belly dance" is a translation of the French term danse du ventre. The name first appeared
                            in 1864 in a review of the Orientalist painting The Dance of the Almeh by Jean-Léon
                            Gérôme.[8][9]

                            The first known use of the term "belly dance" in English is in reference to the Middle
                            Eastern dancers who performed at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889.<br><br>

                            Raqs sharqi ('Eastern Dance' or 'Dance of the Orient') is a broad category of professional
                            forms of the dance, including forms of belly dance popularly known today, such as Raqs
                            Baladi, Sa'idi, Ghawazee, and Awalim. The informal, social form of the dance is known as
                            Raqs Baladi ('Dance of the Country' or 'Folk Dance') in Egyptian Arabic and is considered an
                            indigenous dance.<br><br>

                            Belly dance is primarily a torso-driven dance, with an emphasis on articulations of the
                            hips.[10] Unlike many Western dance forms, the focus of the dance is on isolations of the
                            torso muscles, rather than on movements of the limbs through space. Although some of these
                            isolations appear similar to the isolations used in jazz ballet, they are sometimes driven
                            differently and have a different feeling or emphasis.
