                            Salsa is a partnered dance where the lead takes the follower through a series of spins and
                            turn patterns to music. Salsa's tempo ranges from about 150bpm (beats per minute) to around
                            250bpm, although most dancing is done to music somewhere between 160 and 220bpm. The
                            basic Salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for every four beats of music. Salsa
                            dancers can also break apart to dance solo, known as "shines".<br><br>

                            The two main styles of salsa are linear and circular. In linear salsa, dancers remain in
                            their "slot", switching places from one side of the slot to the other, similar to West Coast
                            Swing â€” New York-style salsa and LA-style salsa are both danced this way. The second salsa
                            style is circular salsa. Here, dancers circle around each other, reminiscent of East Coast
                            Swing. Both Cuban and Colombian salsa follow this circular pattern.<br><br>

                            Incorporating other dance styling techniques into salsa dancing has become very common for
                            both men and women: shimmies, leg work, arm work, body movement, spins, body isolations,
                            shoulder shimmies, rolls, even hand styling, acrobatics, and lifts.<br><br>
